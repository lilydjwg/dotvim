Revert to use neocomplcache

This, and previous commits, revert the switch from neocomplcache to neocomplete
and neosnippet, because neocomplete needs +lua, but that's not support
everywhere. This, as a branch, acts as a backup solution.

These reverts are generated by the following command:

git log --grep=neo --grep=snippet --no-merges --pretty='format: %H' neocomplcache_end..HEAD | xargs git revert --no-edit
