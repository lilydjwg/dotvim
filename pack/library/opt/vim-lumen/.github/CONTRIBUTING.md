# Contributing

## Issues and bug reports
When reporting issues, please include your vim config if relevant. If you don't know what parts of your config are relevant, it is okay to just paste your entire config.
Often it is also helpful to include the output of `:echo lumen#debug#info()` or `:checkhealth lumen` in neovim.

## Development
Code contributions are much welcomed and appreciated.
Here are a few guidelines to help you get started:

### Code Guidelines
- If you add a new option, document it in the vim help file. Documenting it in the [README](/README.md) is NOT sufficient (and not even needed for most options). Take a look at [the existing helpfile](/doc/lumen.txt) and document in a similar style.
- Never change basic vim options just because they make more sense for you. Plugins should never overwrite unrelated settings
- Only add comments if they bring extra info to the table, don't just reiterate obvious code
- Often good variable names are much more worth than comments
- If you need more than 10 seconds to understand a single line of code, then absolutely DO add a comment
- If you implement a feature only for Neovim, write it in such an abstract way that it is easy to add a Vim implementation later
- Similarly if you implement a feature only for one platform, write it in such an abstract way that it is easy to add another platform implementation later

### Testing
Always run the testing suite before submitting a patch, so that you don't break any functionality.
For more info about this take a look at the [documentation](/tests/README.md).

Similarly, if your patch fixes a bug, it would be good if you can add a test that fails before your patch and passes after your patch.
You can take a look at some existing test files to help you get started.

### Submitting Patches
You can either submit your changes as a pull request on Github or send them via email to me. In the latter case make sure that your email client does not break the formatting of your patch, I recommend using `git send-email` for this.
