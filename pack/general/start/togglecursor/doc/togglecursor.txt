This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set, and your vim has
been compiled with |+cursorshape| support.

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                     *togglecursor*

In gVim, when you change from normal mode to insert mode, the cursor shape
typically changes from a block cursor to a line ('|') cursor.  However, in a
terminal, you lose that feature.  This plugin aims to help bring it back on
supported terminals.

==============================================================================
SUPPORTED TERMINALS                              *togglecursor-supported*

Currently supported terminals are iTerm2 for the Mac (version 1.0.0.20130602
beta or better is required), Mac's native Terminal (2.7 or better, starting in
Sierra), rxvt-unicode (version 9.21 or better), VTE3 based terminals (including
gnome-terminal), kitty (version 0.6 or better), and KDE's Konsole.  XTerm 252 or
better is supported as well.  XTerms younger than 282 don't support the line
cursor, so this plugin currently sets the cursor to an underline instead for
insert mode.

Older versions of VTE3 based terminals (before v0.39) do not support changing 
the cursor via escape sequences and are not supported.  On unsupported 
terminals, Vim's default behavior is left unaltered.

The plugin also supports tmux, and will change your cursor inside a tmux
session too.

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                          *togglecursor-options*

All the cursor options take a string representing the shape.  The shape is
allowed to be one of 'block', 'blinking_block', 'line', 'blinking_line',
'underline', or 'blinking_underline'.

                                                 *togglecursor_default*
g:togglecursor_default  The default cursor shape.  It is used in all modes
                        except insert mode.  The default value is
                        'blinking_block', where it's known to be supported,
                        and 'block' otherwise.

                                                 *togglecursor_insert*
g:togglecursor_insert   The insert mode cursor shape.  The default value is
                        'blinking_line' where supported, 'line' if the vertical
                        line cursor is supported, or 'blinking_underline' if
                        neither is supported.

                                                 *togglecursor_leave*
g:togglecursor_leave    The cursor shape to set when exiting Vim.  The default
                        value is 'block', except on VTE-based terminals which
                        commonly have blinking cursor and defaults to
                        'blinking_block'.

                                                 *togglecursor_replace*
g:togglecursor_replace  The replace mode cursor shape.  The default value is
                        'underline'.

                                                 *togglecursor_force*
g:togglecursor_force    Force togglecursor to use a particular mechanism to
                        change the cursor.  Setting this turns off automatic
                        detection.  The only valid choices are 'xterm' (which
                        uses the DESCCUSR escape sequence) and 'cursorshape'
                        (what Konsole uses).

                                                 *togglecursor_disable_tmux*

In some versions of tmux, the passthrough handling appears to be slightly
broken.  When you are on the last line of a short file, and delete a line with
'dd', tmux appears to insert an extra line into the mix and distorts the
terminal.  It appears to be fixed in tmux 1.7.  If you'd like to disable using
tmux passthrough support to try and change the cursor, do the following in
your vimrc: >

    let g:togglecursor_disable_tmux = 1

The default value for |togglecursor_disable_tmux| is 0.

Note: options should be overridden in your vimrc.  Changing them after Vim has
loaded will have little or no effect.

                                                 *togglecursor_disable_neovim*
By default, togglecursor will detect the presence of Neovim and turn on
NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_CURSOR_SHAPE environment variable for you.  If you don't want
this behavior, you can add the following to your vimrc: >

    let g:togglecursor_disable_neovim = 1
<
Note: if you've already defined NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_CURSOR_SHAPE to a non-empty
value, then togglecursor will leave it alone.  Also, Neovim's environment
variable detection can't tell the difference between an unset variable and
an empty variable.  So togglecursor may enable cursor support even though you've
attempted to opt-out of it.  Setting g:togglecursor_disable_neovim will keep
togglecursor from attempting to set the NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_CURSOR_SHAPE variable.

                                             *togglecursor_disable_default_init*
To support changing the normal mode cursor, togglecursor modifies 't_ti' to
include an escape sequence to modify the cursor.  It has been seen on VTE
0.40.2-based terminals that this can cause the cursor to disappear.

To allow users to workaround this kind of bug, you can set
g:togglecursor_disable_default_init to a non-zero value in your vimrc: >

    let g:togglecursor_disable_default_init = 1
<
This will prevent togglecursor from altering 't_ti' at the cost of not having
the correct cursor when first entering Vim.  Once you go into insert mode and
back to normal mode, you'll find that the cursor has changed to the desired
type.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS                                      *togglecursor-limitations*

Since this plugin relies on detecting on the type of terminal being run, it
will not work automatically when working remotely.  The required environment
variables are simply not available.

This also doesn't support all terminals, see |togglecursor-supported| for
details.  Others may be added later, as long as there is a safe way to detect
and add that support.

Also, this plugin works by setting the |t_SI|, |t_EI|, |t_ti|, and |t_te|
options and including special escape codes to let the terminal know how to
change the cursor.  I've tried to avoid doing anything that would cause bad
interaction with the terminal, but sometimes bugs happen.  If you run into an
environment where cursor changing is a problem, put the following into your
vimrc to disable the plugin: >

    let g:loaded_togglecursor = 0

Once such bug appears to exist in tmux 1.6, at least under Fedora 16.  If you
experience troubles with cursor changing under tmux, you can disable cursor
changing only under tmux using the |togglecursor_disable_tmux| option.

It's also been noticed that Konsole will clear the profile name when using
togglecursor.  It turns out that toggling the cursor--even through ANSI
sequences--modifies the profile causing Konsole to clear the name.  As a
result, if you make other changes you'll want to select your normal profile
name and save them there.  The bug has been reported to Konsole, but it's
unclear what they're going to do about it.  The bug was reported here:
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=323227.

Note: Neovim doesn't allow the technique used by togglecursor to work.  Neovim
does natively have the ability to change cursor shape by the
NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_CURSOR_SHAPE environment variable--though you cannot control
the shapes.  The plugin will set this environment variable for you, but will not
offer any control over the actual shapes.  In fact, it will look like the plugin
hasn't loaded--the environment variable is set, and then the plugin exits.

If you find that the Neovim's sequences are not working for your terminal, you
can disable this feature using |togglecursor_disable_neovim|.

There has been a report of the cursor going missing on start-up with VTE
0.40.2-based terminals.  If you're seeing this issue, take a look at
|togglecursor_disable_default_init|.  Note: the issue was fixed in VTE 0.41.90.

==============================================================================
TIPS                                             *togglecursor-tips*

On most systems, the default SSH settings will not transmit the TERM_PROGRAM
environment variable to the remote system, which is used by togglecursor to help
determine how to change the cursor.  If you'd like togglecursor to work for your
remote session, then you must edit the SSH server configuration as well as your
client configuration.

The typical unix location for your ssh client configuration is in ~/.ssh/config.
Simply add the following line to the file: >

    SendEnv TERM_PROGRAM
<
On the server side, the configuration is typically in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.  Add
TERM_PROGRAM to the list of accepted environment variables.  It should look
something like this: >

    AcceptEnv LANG LC_* TERM_PROGRAM
<
Now the TERM_PROGRAM environment variable will be passed to the remote session
and togglecursor will be able to change the cursor correctly.

You can configure Konsole to set TERM_PROGRAM by editing the environment in
'Settings->Edit Current Profile->General' and adding the following line: >

    TERM_PROGRAM=Konsole
<
==============================================================================
SUDO                                            *togglecursor-sudo*

The sudo tool scrubs the environment by default, preventing most environment
variables from being forwarded into the new sudo environment, which prevents
togglecursor from being able to detect the running terminal.  To allow
auto-detection, you need to tell sudo to keep these environment
variables.  This is done by using visudo to modify /etc/sudoers and add
something like the following to file: >

    Defaults env_keep += "TERM_PROGRAM VTE_VERSION XTERM_VERSION"
<
The exact variables to add depend on what you use.  For instance, if you use
Konsole, you may need to add KONSOLE_DBUS_SESSION to the list.

Another alternative is to set |togglecursor_force| to the correct value for the
terminal you use and skip autodetection.
