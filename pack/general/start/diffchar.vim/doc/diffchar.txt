INTRODUCTION                                           *diffchar*

This plugin has been developed in order to make diff mode more useful. Vim
highlights all the text in between the first and last different characters on
a changed line. But this plugin will find the exact differences between them,
character by character - so called DiffChar.

For example, in diff mode: (`-`:`hl-DiffText` / |+|:|hl-DiffAdd|)
    +-------------------------------------------------+
    |The `quick brown fox jumps over the lazy` dog.     |
    |    `-----------------------------------`          |
    |~                                                |
    +-------------------------------------------------+
    |The `lazy fox jumps over the quick brown` dog.     |
    |    `-----------------------------------`          |
    |~                                                |
    +-------------------------------------------------+

This plugin will exactly show the changed and added units:
    +-------------------------------------------------+
    |The `quick` |brown| fox jumps over the `lazy` dog.     |
    |    `-----` |++++++|                   `----`          |
    |~                                                |
    +-------------------------------------------------+
    |The `lazy` fox jumps over the `quick` |brown| dog.     |
    |    `----`                    `-----` |++++++|         |
    |~                                                |
    +-------------------------------------------------+

Sync with diff mode ~
This plugin will synchronously show/reset the highlights of the exact
differences as soon as the diff mode begins/ends. And the exact differences
will be kept updated while editing.

Diff unit ~
This plugin shows the diffs based on a |g:DiffUnit|. Its default is 'Word1'
and it handles a \w\+ word and a \W character as a diff unit. There are other
types of word provided and you can also set 'Char' to compare character by
character. In addition, you can specify one or more diff unit delimiters, such
as comma (','), colon (':'), tab ("\t"), and HTML tag symbols ('<' and '>'),
and also specify a custom pattern in the |g:DiffUnit|.

Diff matching colors ~
In diff mode, the corresponding |hl-DiffChange| lines are compared between two
windows. As a default, all the changed units are highlighted with
|hl-DiffText|. You can set |g:DiffColors| to use more than one matching color
to make it easy to find the corresponding units between two windows. The
number of colors depends on the color scheme. In addition, |hl-DiffAdd| is
always used for the added units and both the previous and next character of
the deleted units are shown in bold/underline.

Diff pair visible ~
While showing the exact differences, when the cursor is moved on a diff unit,
you can see its corresponding unit highlighted with |hl-Cursor|,
|hl-TermCursor|, or similar one in another window, based on a
|g:DiffPairVisible|. If you change its default, the corresponding unit is
echoed in the command line or displayed in a popup/floating window just below
the cursor position or at the mouse position. Those options take effect on
`:diffupdate` command as well.

Jump to next/prev diff unit ~
You can use `]b` or `]e` to jump cursor to start or end position of the next
diff unit, and `[b` or `[e` to the start or end position of the previous unit.

Get/put a diff unit ~
Like line-based `:diffget`/`:diffput` and `do`/`dp` vim commands, you can use
`<Leader>g` and `<Leader>p` commands in normal mode to get and put each diff
unit, where the cursor is on, between 2 buffers and undo its difference. Those
keymaps are configurable in your vimrc and so on.

Check diff lines locally ~
When the diff mode begins, this plugin locally checks the |hl-DiffChange|
lines in the limited range of the current visible and its upper/lower lines of
a window. And each time a cursor is moved on to another range upon scrolling
or searching, those diff lines will be checked in that range. Which means,
independently of the file size, the number of lines to be checked and then the
time consumed are always constant.

Tab page individual ~
This plugin works on each tab page individually. You can use a tab page
variable (t:), instead of a global one (g:), to specify different options on
each tab page. Note that this plugin can not handle more than two diff mode
windows in a tab page. If it would happen, to prevent any trouble, all the
highlighted units are to be reset in the tab page.

Follow 'diffopt' option ~
This plugin supports "icase", "iwhite", "iwhiteall", and "iwhiteeol" in the
'diffopt' option. In addition, when "indent-heuristic" is specified,
positioning of the added/deleted diff units is adjusted to reduce the number
of diff hunks and make them easier to read.

Comparison algorithm ~
To find the exact differences, this plugin uses "An O(NP) Sequence Comparison
Algorithm" developed by S.Wu, et al., which always finds an optimum sequence.
But it takes time to check a long and dissimilar line. To improve the
performance, the algorithm is also implemented in Vim9 script. In addition,
if available, this plugin uses a builtin diff function (|diff()| in vim
patch-9.1.0071 and Lua |vim.diff()| in nvim 0.6.0) and makes it much faster.

* Improved performance, use the external diff command together if available,
  if there are so many diff units included in a line or it has taken much time
  in a diff session.
