DESCRIPTION						*CountJump-description*

Though it is not difficult to write a custom |movement| (basically a |:map|
that executes some kind of search or jump) and a custom |text-object| (an
|:omap| that selects a range of text), this is too complex for a novice user
and often repetitive. 
This plugin covers the common use case where the movement and boundaries of a
text object can be specified via start and end patterns, and offers a single
function to set up related mappings. With it, you can enhance some built-in
Vim mappings to take an optional [count], and quickly define new mappings for
help file sections, diff hunks, embedded macros, and so on... 

As a generalization of the start and end patterns, the movement and boundaries
of a text object can also be specified via jump functions, i.e. Funcrefs of
functions that position the cursor on the appropriate location and return that
location. This can be used where the jump is difficult to express with a
single regular expression, the jump may need adapting depending on the
context, or other uses. 
This plugin contains some support for movement and text objects consisting of
text regions that can be defined by continuous lines that match a particular
pattern, e.g. comment blocks that all start with /^\s*#/.

mail_movement     (vimscript #3182): Movement over email quotes with ]] etc.


RELATED WORKS *

- motpat.vim (vimscript #3030) offers similar functions to setup motion
  mappings, but no text objects (yet). 
- textobj-user (vimscript #2100) has support for user-defined text objects via
  regular expressions. 

==============================================================================
USAGE							      *CountJump-usage*

The plugin defines several functions, which set up the appropriate mappings
based on the arguments that you supply. The following is an overview; you'll
find the details directly in the implementation files in the
.vim/autoload/CountJump/ directory. 

CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotion( mapArgs, keyAfterBracket, inverseKeyAfterBracket, patternToBegin, patternToEnd, isEndPatternToEnd, ... )

This function sets up mappings starting with [ and ] for movement (with
optional [count]) relative to the current cursor position, targeting either a
text pattern at the beginning ([{keyAfterBracket} mapping) or a text pattern
at the end (]{inverseKeyAfterBracket} mapping) of whatever you want to treat
as a text block. 

CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotionWithJumpFunctions( mapArgs, keyAfterBracket, inverseKeyAfterBracket, JumpToBeginForward, JumpToBeginBackward, JumpToEndForward, JumpToEndBackward, isEndJumpToEnd, ... )

This function sets up mappings starting with [ and ] for movement (with
optional [count]) relative to the current cursor position, but rely on four
passed jump functions instead of text patterns to do the movement. 


CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithCountSearch( mapArgs, textObjectKey, types, selectionMode, patternToBegin, patternToEnd )

Defines a complete set of mappings for inner and/or outer text objects that
support an optional [count] and are driven by search patterns for the
beginning and end of a block. Outer text objects include the matched pattern
text, inner ones not. Selection can be characterwise, linewise or blockwise. 


CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithJumpFunctions( mapArgs, textObjectKey, types, selectionMode, JumpToBegin, JumpToEnd )

This is a generalization of CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithCountSearch() that
invokes custom functions instead of searching for a fixed pattern. This is
useful if the check for a match is too complex for a single regular
expression, or if you need to adjust the match position depending on the
circumstances. 


Often, a region can be defined as a block of continuous lines that all match a
certain pattern. The following functions aid in implementing movements to the
boundaries of these regions and text objects consisting of the region: 

CountJump#Region#JumpToRegionEnd( count, pattern, isMatch, step, isToEndOfLine )

Starting from the current line, search for the position where the count'th
region ends. Use this function to build Funcrefs for forward / backward jumps
that can then be passed to CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithJumpFunctions(). 

CountJump#Region#JumpToNextRegion( count, pattern, isMatch, step, isAcrossRegion, isToEndOfLine )

Starting from the current line, search for the position where the count'th
region begins/ends. 

CountJump#Region#Motion#MakeBracketMotion( mapArgs, keyAfterBracket, inverseKeyAfterBracket, pattern, isMatch, ... )

This function sets up mappings starting with [ and ] for movement (with
optional [count]) relative to the current cursor position, targeting a text
region defined by contiguous lines that (don't) match a:pattern. 

CountJump#Region#TextObject#Make( mapArgs, textObjectKey, types, selectionMode, pattern, isMatch )

Defines a complete set of mappings for inner and/or outer text objects that
support an optional [count] and select regions of lines which are defined by
contiguous lines that (don't) match a:pattern. 
The inner text object comprises all lines of the region itself, while the
outer text object also includes all adjacent lines above and below which do
not themselves belong to a region. 

==============================================================================
EXAMPLE							   *CountJump-example*

Let's illustrate the usage by developing custom motions and text objects for
Pascal begin..end blocks. 

We want to move around blocks, and override the default section movements for
it: 
]]			Go to [count] next start of a block. 
][			Go to [count] next end of a block. 
[[			Go to [count] previous start of a block. 
[]			Go to [count] previous end of a block. 
>
    call CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotion('<buffer>', '', '', '\c^begin\n\zs', '\c^.*\nend', 0)
The begin pattern positions the cursor on the beginning of the line following
the "begin" keyword, the end pattern on the beginning of the line
preceding the "end" keyword. 


We want to select a block, either including or excluding the lines with the
begin..end keywords: 
ib			"inner block" text object, select [count] contents of
			a block. 
ab			"a block" text object, select [count] blocks. 
>
    call CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithCountSearch('<buffer>', 'b', 'ai', 'V', '\c^begin\n', '\c^end.*$')

If there is a filetype detection for Pascal files, we can simply put the
above calls in a ~/.vim/ftplugin/pascal_movement.vim script and are done.

INSTALLATION					       *CountJump-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim CountJump.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command. 

DEPENDENCIES					       *CountJump-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS						*CountJump-limitations*

KNOWN PROBLEMS					     *CountJump-known-problems*

- An outer text object cannot consist of the same, multiple characters;
  nothing will be selected (because the end pattern also matches at the begin
  position). A same single character pattern works, though. 
- For blockwise text objects, the original cursor position should be required
  to be inside the selection. However, this requires translation of the
  byte-indices here into screen columns, and is thus non-trivial to implement. 

TODO							       *CountJump-todo*

IDEAS							      *CountJump-ideas*

- Add configuration to change behavior when there are no [count] matches: 
  1. obey the 'wrapscan' option, like |]s| and/or
  2. jump as many matches as possible, still beep to indicate the actual
     target was not reached

- Add customization parameter so that the motion / text object includes the
  start / end of buffer in case patternToBegin / patternToEnd do not match any
  more. 

==============================================================================
HISTORY							    *CountJump-history*

1.41	13-Jun-2011
- FIX: Directly ring the bell to avoid problems when running under :silent!. 

1.40	20-Dec-2010
- ENH: Added CountJump#Region#TextObject#Make() to easily define text objects
  for regions. 
- Interface change: Jump functions again return position (and actual,
  corrected one for a:isToEndOfLine). Though the position is not used for
  motions, it is necessary for text objects to differentiate between "already
  at the begin/end position" and "no such position".  

1.30	20-Dec-2010
- ENH: Added CountJump#Region#Motion#MakeBracketMotion() to easily define
  bracket motions for regions. 
- Interface changes: 
  - Jump functions don't necessarily return jump position any more; this
    special case is only required for text objects. 
  - Moved CountJump#Region#Jump() to CountJump#JumpFunc(). 
  - Added a:isToEndOfLine argument to CountJump#Region#JumpToRegionEnd() and
    CountJump#Region#JumpToNextRegion(), which is useful for operator-pending
    and characterwise visual mode mappings; the entire last line will then be
    operated on / selected. 
  - Added a:isMatch argument to CountJump#Region#SearchForRegionEnd(),
    CountJump#Region#JumpToRegionEnd(),
    CountJump#Region#SearchForNextRegion(),
    CountJump#Region#JumpToNextRegion(). This allows definition of regions via
    non-matches, which can be substantially simpler (and faster to match) than
    coming up with a "negative" regular expression.

1.22	06-Aug-2010
- No more motion mappings and text objects for select mode; as the mappings
  start with a printable character, no select-mode mapping should be defined. 

1.21	03-Aug-2010
- FIX: A 2]] jump inside a region (unless last line) jumped like a 1]] jump.
  The search for next region must not decrease the iteration counter when
  _not_ searching _across_ the region. 
- FIX: Must not do (characterwise) end position adaptation for linewise text
  object that does not exclude boundaries. 
- Switched example from email fortunes to Pascal begin..end blocks, as they
  are conceptually easier. 

1.20	02-Aug-2010
- ENH: In CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotion(), a:keyAfterBracket and
  a:inverseKeyAfterBracket can now be empty, the resulting mappings are then
  omitted. Likewise, any jump function can be empty in
  CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotionWithJumpFunctions().
- With the added CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotionWithJumpFunctions() motions
  can be defined via jump functions, similar to how text objects can be
  defined. 
- Added CountJump/Region.vim to move to borders of a region defined by lines
  matching a pattern. 
- FIX: CountJump#CountJump() with mode "O" didn't add original position to
  jump list. 
- The previous visual selection is kept when the text object could not be
  selected. (Beforehand, a new selection of the text object's selection type
  was created.) 
- The adjustment movements after the jumps to the text object boundaries now
  do not cause beeps if that movement cannot be done (e.g. a 'j' at the end of
  the buffer). 

1.10    19-Jul-2010
- Changed behavior if there aren't [count] matches: Instead of jumping to the
  last available match (and ringing the bell), the cursor stays at the
  original position, like with the old vi-compatible motions. 
- ENH: Only adding to jump list if there actually is a match. This is like the
  built-in Vim motions work. 
- FIX: For a linewise text object, the end cursor column is not important; do
  not compare with the original cursor column in this case.
