DESCRIPTION					*SameSyntaxMotion-description*

Vim offers many different powerful motions to position the cursor, but none
leverages the syntactic analysis of the built-in syntax highlighting.

This plugin provides mappings to jump to the borders and next [count]
occurrences of text highlighted in the same way as under the cursor. So when
you're in a large block of comments, a quick |[y| will take you to the
beginning of the comment. The |ay| and |iy| text objects will select the
surrounding text that belongs to the same syntax group, or is highlighted the
same way.

RELATED WORKS								     *

- The SyntaxMotion plugin (vimscript #2965) by Dominique Pellé provides very
  similar motions for normal and visual mode, but no operator-pending and text
  objects. It does not skip over contained sub-syntax items and uses same
  color as the distinguishing property.

==============================================================================
USAGE						      *SameSyntaxMotion-usage*

"Same syntax" in the context of the mappings and text objects means:
1. The same highlight group is used to highlight the text. Transparent syntax
   groups are ignored, highlight links are followed. Depending on the
   colorscheme, this usually means if it has the same color and attributes,
   it's the same, though (especially in low-color terminals) multiple
   highlight groups may have the same visual appearance, but are _not_
   identical.
2. The same syntax group as under the cursor. When this group contains other
   syntax groups (possibly with different highlighting), these are included.
   So when you have escape sequences in a string ("foo\<CR>bar"), quoted words
   in a comment (# a "foo" piece), or keywords in a docstring (@author Ernie),
   the entire text is treated as one syntax area, even though there are
   different-colored pieces inside.
3. Unhighlighted whitespace between the same syntax items is skipped. So when
   there are multiple keywords in a row (FOO BAR BAZ), they are treated as one
   area, even though the whitespace between them is not covered by the syntax.

   *]y* *]Y* *[y* *[Y* *v_]y* *v_]Y* *v_[y* *v_[Y* *o_]y* *o_]Y* *o_[y* *o_[Y*
]y			Go to [count] next start of the same syntax.
]Y			Go to [count] next end of the same syntax.
[y			Go to [count] previous start of the same syntax.
[Y			Go to [count] previous end of the same syntax.
			The 'wrapscan' setting applies.

						       *ay* *v_ay* *iy* *v_iy*
ay			"a syntax" text object, select [count] same syntax
			areas.
iy			"inner syntax" text object, select [count] same syntax
			areas within the same line. Whitespace around the
			syntax area is not included. Unhighlighted whitespace
			delimits same syntax items here, so this selects
			individual keywords.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				       *SameSyntaxMotion-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SameSyntaxMotion*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				       *SameSyntaxMotion-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the CountJump plugin (vimscript #3130), version 1.80 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				      *SameSyntaxMotion-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
						      *SameSyntaxMotion-remap*
To change the default motion mappings, use: >
    let g:SameSyntaxMotion_BeginMapping = 'y'
    let g:SameSyntaxMotion_EndMapping = 'Y'
To also change the [ / ] prefix to something else, follow the instructions for
|CountJump-remap-motions|.

To change the default text object mappings, use: >
    let g:SameSyntaxMotion_TextObjectMapping = 'y'
To also change the a prefix to something else, follow the instructions for
|CountJump-remap-text-objects|.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS					*SameSyntaxMotion-limitations*

- Because the algorithm has to sequentially inspect every character's syntax
  groups, movement (especially when there's no additional match and the search
  continues to the buffer's border or wraps around) can be noticeably slow.
