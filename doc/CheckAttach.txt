1. Functionality

When using mutt as your mail user agent, you can specify which files to attach
using the pseudo header :Attach. This only works when edit_headers is set in
your .muttrc configuration file. See the mutt manual for further information
about that topic.

A simple version of this plugin has been posted to the mutt-users list (see
http://marc.info/?i=20090116091203.GB3197%20()%20256bit%20!%20org) and
after using it for some time, I decided to make a plugin out of it.

This plugin checks, whether certain keywords exist in your mail, and if found,
you'll be asked to attach the files. This is done to prevent that you sent
mails in which you announce to attach some files but actually forget to attach
the files so that your have to write a second mail which often is quite
embarassing.

Therefore this plugin checks for the presence of keywords which indicate that
an attachment should be attached. If if finds these keywords, the plugin will
highlight the keywords and ask you for the files to attach, whenever you save
your mail.

This looks like this:
Attach file: (leave empty to abbort):

At that prompt you can specify any file you'd like to attach. It allows
filename completion, so you can use <Tab> to let vim complete file paths.
Additionally you can specify glob patterns and let vim attach all files, that
match the pattern. So if you enter ~/.vim/plugin/*.vim vim would add for each
plugin it finds an Attach-header.  If you enter an empty value or "n" (without
the quotes), no file will be attached.

The plugin will by default escape blank space in your filename by using '\'.
mutt before version 1.5.20 had a bug, that would not allow you to add files
whose filename contain spaces. If you are using mutt version smaller 1.5.20
this means you would have to rename those files first before attaching them.
(See mutt bug 3179: http://dev.mutt.org/trac/ticket/3179)

You can specify which keywords will be searched by setting the
g:attach_check_keywords variable. By default this variable is specified as:
let g:attach_check_keywords = 'attached,attachment,angehängt,Anhang'
so that it can handle German and English. If you would like to add the keyword
foobar, use this command:

let g:attach_check_keywords =',foobar'

NOTE: The comma is important. It is used to seperate the different keywords
and needs to be included.

If you'd like to suggest adding additional keywords (for your language),
please contact the author (see first line of this help page).

                                      *:EnableCheckAttach* *:DisableCheckAttach*
You can disable the plugin by issuing the command >
    :DisableCheckAttach
Enabling the attachment check is then again enabled by issuing >
    :EnableCheckAttach
You can also use the ! attribute when saving your buffer to temporarily skip
the check. So if you use :w! the buffer will not be checked for attachments,
only if you use :w it will.

                                                            *:AttachFile*
The plugin also defines the command :AttachFile. This allows you to simply
attache any number of files, using a glob pattern. So, if you like to attach
all your pictures from ~/pictures/ you can simply enter: >
     :AttachFile ~/picutures/*.jpg
and all jpg files will be attached automatically. You can use <Tab> to
complete the directory.
