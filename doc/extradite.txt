:Extradite              Toggle the Extradite buffer. By default, it opens in the
                        current window. Adding |!| makes it open in a vertical
                        split instead. The width of the split is set with
                        *g:extradite_width*
                        To not resize the split, set
                        *g:extradite_resize*
                        to 0 in your .vimrc
                        To show abbreviated commit hashes in the buffer, set
                        *g:extradite_showhash*
                        to 1 in your .vimrc
                        To use vertical split instead of horizontal one, set
                        *g:extradite_diff_split*
                        to 'belowright vertical split'.
