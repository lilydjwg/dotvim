2. Visual Block Manual			*visman* *vismanual* *vis-manual* *v_:B*

	Performs an arbitrary Ex command on a visual highlighted block.

	Mark visual block (CTRL-V) or visual character (v),
		press ':B ' and enter an Ex command [cmd].

		ex. Use ctrl-v to visually mark the block then use
			:B cmd     (will appear as   :'<,'>B cmd )

		ex. Use v to visually mark the block then use
			:B cmd     (will appear as   :'<,'>B cmd )

	Command-line completion is supported for Ex commands.

	There must be a space before the '!' when invoking external shell
	commands, eg. ':B !sort'. Otherwise an error is reported.

	Doesn't work as one might expect with Vim's ve option.  That's
	because ve=all ended up leaving unwanted blank columns, so the
	solution chosen was to have the vis function turn ve off temporarily.

	The script works by deleting the selected region into register "a.
	The register "a itself is first saved and later restored.  The text is
	then put at the end-of-file, modified by the user command, and then
	deleted back into register "a.  Any excess lines are removed, and the
	modified text is then put back into the text at its original
	location.

	Based on idea of Stefan Roemer <roemer@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>;
	the implementation and method has completely changed since the
	original.


==============================================================================
3. Visual Block Search				*vis-search* *vis-srch* *vis-S*

	Visual block search provides two ways to get visual-selection
	based searches.  Both these methods work well with :set hls
	and searching may be repeated with the n or N commands.
	
	Using // and ?? after a visual selection:
>
		ex. select region via V, v, or ctrl-v
		    //pattern
<
	    You'll actually get a long leader string of commands to restrict
	    searches to the requested visual block first.  You may then enter
	    the pattern afterwards.  For example, using "v" to select this
	    paragraph, you'll see something like: >

		/\%(\%(\%63l\%>12c\)\|\%(\%66l\%<51c\)\|\%(\%>63l\%<66l\)\)\&
<
	    You may enter whatever pattern you want after the \&, and the
	    pattern search will be restricted to the requested region.
	
	The "S" command in visual mode:
>
		ex. select region via V, v, or ctrl-v
		    :S pattern
<
	    The ":S pattern" will appear as ":'<,'>S pattern".  This
	    command will move the cursor to the next instance of the
	    pattern, restricted to the visually selected block.
	
	An "R" command was contemplated, but I currently see no way to
	get it to continue to search backwards with n and N commands.


==============================================================================
4. Required							*vis-required*

	Since the <vis.vim> function is a plugin, it uses several 6.0 (or
	later) features.  Please use a 6.0 or later version of vim.

	Starting with version 11, <vis.vim> required <cecutil.vim>.  It uses
	the SaveWinPosn() and RestoreWinPosn() functions therein.  You may get
	<cecutil.vim> from

		http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#VimFuncs
		as "DrC's Utilities".


==============================================================================
5. Sorting Examples						*vis-sort*

	Assume we start with the following three lines: >

    	    one   two   three
    	    four  five  six
    	    seven eight nine
<
	Example 1: Use visual-block mode to select the center three
	words: ctrl-v select two/five/eight, then :'<,'>sort: >

    	    four  five  six
    	    one   two   three
    	    seven eight nine
<
	Note that the visual-block is ignored, other than as a way to
	select the three lines.  The resulting sorting is done on the
	three words "one/four/seven".

	(this example presumed that you're using vim 7.0; if you're using
	an earlier version vim, try  :'<,\> !sort  instead)

	Example 2: Using vis.vim's B command:
	Again, use visual-block mode to select the center
	three words: ctrl-v select two/five/eight, then :'<,'>B sort: >

    	    one   eight three
    	    four  five  six
    	    seven two   nine
<
	This operation sorts the selected three words (two/five/eight),
	leaving all characters outside the visual block alone.

	(this example presumed that you're using vim 7.0; if you're using
	an earlier version vim, try  :'<,\> !sort  instead)

	Example 3: Using vissort.vim's Vissort() function
	Use visual block mode to select the center three words;
	ctrl-v select two/five/eight, then :'<,'>Vissort: >

    	    seven eight nine
    	    four  five  six
    	    one   two   three
<
	This time, the entire lines are sorted, but the sorting is done
	based on the visual-block selected region (ie. two/five/eight).

6. History						*vis-history* {{{1

    v19 : Jan 06, 2006  - small modification included to allow AlignMaps
                          maps to work (visual select, :B norm \somemap)
			- cecutil updated to use keepjumps
	  Jan 24, 2006  - works around formatoption setting
	  Jan 25, 2006  - uses SaveWinPosn(0) to avoid SWP stack use
    v18 : Jul 11, 2005  - vis.vim now works around a virtcol() behavior
                          difference between ve=all vs ve=block
    v17 : Apr 25, 2005  - vis.vim now uses cecutil (SaveWinPosn, etc) so the
                          tarball now includes a copy of cecutil.vim
    v16 : Feb 02, 2005  - fixed a bug with visual-block + S ; the first line
			  was being omitted in the search
	  Mar 01, 2005  - <q-args> used instead of '<args>'
	  Apr 13, 2005  - :'<,'>S plus v had a bug with one or two line
	                  selections (tnx to Vigil for pointing this out)
	  Apr 14, 2005  - set ignorecase caused visual-block searching
	                  to confuse visual modes "v" and "V"
    v15 : Feb 01, 2005  - includes some additions to the help
    v14 : Sep 28, 2004	- visual-block based searching now supported.  One

    v11 : May 18, 2004	- Included calls to SaveWinPosn() and RestoreWinPosn()
			  to prevent unwanted movement of the cursor and window.
			  As a result, <vis.vim> now requires <cecutil.vim>
			  (see |vis-required|).
    v10 : Feb 11, 2003	- bugfix (ignorecase option interfered with v)
     v9 : Sep 10, 2002	- bugfix (left Decho on, now commented out)

     v6 : Jun 25, 2002	- bugfix (VirtcolM1 instead of virtcol()-1)
     v5 : Jun 21, 2002	- now supports character-visual mode (v) and
			  linewise-visual mode (V)
     v4 : Jun 20, 2002	- saves sol, sets nosol, restores sol
			- bugfix: 0 inserted: 0\<c-v>G$\"ad
