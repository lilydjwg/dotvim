DESCRIPTION					 *ConflictMotions-description*

This plugin defines movement commands and text objects to go to and operate on
conflicting lines, as indicated by many revision control systems, like
Subversion, Git, etc. The source code management system inserts conflict
markers such as <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> on merges to indicate that the
automatic resolution failed; this plugin helps you with locating and resolving
these conflicts.

RELATED WORKS								     *

To be alerted to the existence of conflict markers and to visually
differentiate the conflicted lines, you can use the highlighting, warnings and
custom buffer status provided by the companion |ConflictDetection.vim| plugin
(vimscript #4129).

USAGE						       *ConflictMotions-usage*
   *]x* *]X* *[x* *[X* *v_]x* *v_]X* *v_[x* *v_[X* *o_]x* *o_]X* *o_[x* *o_[X*
]x			Go to [count] next start of a conflict.
]X			Go to [count] next end of a conflict.
[x			Go to [count] previous start of a conflict.
[X			Go to [count] previous end of a conflict.
					 *]=* *[=* *v_]=* *v_[=* *o_]=* *o_[=*
]=			Go to [count] next conflict marker.
[=			Go to [count] previous conflict marker.
			Mnemonic: = is in the separator between our and their
			changes.

								   *ax* *v_ax*
ax			"a conflict" text object, select [count] conflicts,
			including the conflict markers.
								   *a=* *v_a=*
a=			"a conflict section" text object, select [count]
			sections (i.e. either ours, theirs, or base) including
			the conflict marker above, and in the case of "theirs"
			changes, also the ending conflict marker below.
								   *i=* *v_i=*
i=			"inner conflict section" text object, select current
			section (i.e. either ours, theirs, or base) without
			the surrounding conflict markers.

							       *:ConflictTake*
:ConflictTake		From the conflict the cursor is in, remove the markers
			and keep the section the cursor is inside.
:ConflictTake [none this ours base theirs both all query] [...]
:ConflictTake [-.<|>+*?][...]
			From the conflict the cursor is in, remove the markers
			and keep the passed section(s) (in the order they are
			specified).
			    none, - = delete the entire conflict
			    both    = ours theirs		(+ = <>)
			    all     = ours [base] theirs	(* = <|>)
			    query   = ask which sections to take
:[range]ConflictTake [none this ours base theirs both all range query] [...]
:[range]ConflictTake [-.<|>+*:?][...]
			When the cursor is inside a conflict, and the [range]
			covers part of that conflict:
			From the conflict the cursor is in, remove the markers
			and keep the passed range (without contained markers)
			(and any passed sections in addition; include the
			"range" argument to put the range somewhere other than
			the end).
			Otherwise, when a large range (like %) is passed:
			For each conflict that starts in [range], remove the
			markers and keep the passed section(s) / ask which
			section(s) should be kept. You can answer the question
			with either the symbol or the choice's starting
			letter. An uppercase letter will apply the choice to
			all following conflicts.

	      *<Leader>xd* *<Leader>x.* *<Leader>x<* *<Leader>x|* *<Leader>x>*
<Leader>xd		Delete the entire current conflict.
<Leader>x.		Keep the current conflict section, delete the rest.
<Leader>x<		Keep our changes, delete the rest.
<Leader>x|		Keep the change base, delete the rest.
<Leader>x>		Keep their changes, delete the rest.

INSTALLATION					*ConflictMotions-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim ConflictMotions*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					*ConflictMotions-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the CountJump plugin (vimscript #3130).
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.004 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				       *ConflictMotions-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

						       *ConflictMotions-remap*
To change the default motion mappings, use: >
    let g:ConflictMotions_ConflictBeginMapping = 'x'
    let g:ConflictMotions_ConflictEndMapping = 'X'
    let g:ConflictMotions_MarkerMapping = '='
To also change the [ / ] prefix to something else, follow the instructions for
|CountJump-remap-motions|. (This requires CountJump 1.60.)

To change the default text object mappings, use: >
    let g:ConflictMotions_ConflictMapping = 'x'
    let g:ConflictMotions_SectionMapping = '='
To also change the i / a prefix to something else, follow the instructions for
|CountJump-remap-text-objects|. (This requires CountJump 1.60.)

If you don't want the mappings for |:ConflictTake|: >
    let g:ConflictMotions_TakeMappingPrefix = ''
To redefine the mappings, either clear the prefix and use the
<Plug>(ConflictMotionsTake...) mapping targets, or adapt via the prefix and
mapping configuration, e.g.: >
    let g:ConflictMotions_TakeMappingPrefix = '<Leader>='
    let g:ConflictMotions_TakeMappings = [['d', 'None'], ['x', 'This'], ['o', 'Ours'], ['b', 'Base'], ['t', 'Theirs']]

IDEAS						       *ConflictMotions-ideas*

==============================================================================
HISTORY						     *ConflictMotions-history*

2.00	23-Apr-2013
- FIX: Don't create the default mapping for
  <Plug>(ConflictMotionsTakeSelection) in select mode; it should insert a
  literal <Leader> there.
- Add the :ConflictTake command to resolve a conflict by picking a section(s).
- Add dependency to ingo-library (vimscript #4433).

1.10	06-Sep-2012
The [z / ]z mappings disable the built-in mappings for moving over the current
open fold. Oops! Change default to [= / ]= / i= / a=. (= as for the characters
in the separator between our and their change).

1.00	28-Mar-2012
First published version.

0.01	12-Mar-2012
Started development.
